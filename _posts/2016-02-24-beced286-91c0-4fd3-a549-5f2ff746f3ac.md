The Museum of Acoustic Geology is pleased to announce a new branch opening soon in Copenhagen, Denmark.  Our Danish curator is pleased with the collection largely based on works of concrete.  MoAG Denmark will also be organizing bunker tours in collaboration with  Atlantikwal-Denmark.  

This continental network of bunkers is so far the most enduring example of concrete sound sculpture.
